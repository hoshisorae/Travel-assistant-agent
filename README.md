# Travel-assistant-agent
This Travel Assistant Agent is a multi-agent system built on the Google ADK. It provides end-to-end, budget-constrained travel planning. The system orchestrates parallel data gathering, iterative budget optimization via a planning loop (`planning_loop_agent`), and generates a detailed Markdown itinerary report for complex user requests.
